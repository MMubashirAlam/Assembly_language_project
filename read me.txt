This MIPS assembly code is implementing a distributed sorting algorithm for three arrays: array1, array2, and array3.
The primary goal is to merge the first two arrays (array1 and array2) into a third array (array3) in sorted order.

1. Data Section:
    Three arrays are defined: array1, array2, and array3, each with 12 bytes (3 words) of storage space.
    A newline string (`newline`) is defined for formatting output.

2. Text Section:
    Registers $s0, $s1, $s2, $s3, $s4, and $s5 are initialized with integer values.
    Register $t0 is used as an index.

3. Initialization of array1 and array2:
    Values from registers $s0, $s1, and $s2 are stored in array1 in sequential locations.
    Values from registers $s3, $s4, and $s5 are stored in array2 in sequential locations.

4. Distributed Sorting (`distributedSort`):
   The program enters a loop where it will iterate 12 times (since we're dealing with 12 elements).
    Inside the loop, the program calls two functions: `findMinArr` and `mergeAll`.
    findMinArr compares the current elements at the same index in array1 and array2 and places the smaller element in array3.
    It also resets the element in `array2` to 0 to mark it as processed.
    mergeAll is called after processing all elements in a single iteration. It moves non-zero elements from array1 and array2 into array3.

5. Merging (merge):
    In the findMinArr function, if the element from array2 is smaller, it is moved to array3, and the element in array2 is marked as 0 (indicating it has been processed).
    In the merge function, the smaller element from array1 is moved to array3, and the element in array1 is marked as 0 (indicating it has been processed).

6. Printing Results (while Loop):
    After sorting and merging, the program enters a loop to print the elements of array3.
    It uses system calls to print integers and newlines.
    The loop continues until all elements of `array3` have been printed.

7. Exit:
   Finally, the program exits with a system call.
